  - Desktop: Images are h-48 (192px) with rounded corners and proper spacing

  - Both desktop and mobile layouts updated with `flex-col` structure
  - **Result**: Visual appeal significantly enhanced with relevant hockey action photos

  - Changed all buttons from filled backgrounds to outline style
  - Applied `border-2 border-yellow-400 dark:border-orange-400` for consistent theming
