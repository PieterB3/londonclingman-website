# London Clingman Website Project

## Background and Motivation
This is a Next.js website project for London Clingman. The project appears to be a personal/professional website with:
- Hero section
- Stats section  
- Navigation
- Theme toggle functionality (dark/light mode)
- Video gallery component
- Contact and About components

**NEW REQUEST: Admin Page for Content Management**
London wants to add an admin page where he can:
- Set YouTube videos for the video gallery
- Upload images for any content on the website
- Manage content with a static password authentication
- Update website content without needing developer assistance

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current State
- Website is successfully deployed on Vercel
- Project uses Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- All core functionality working (theme toggle, video gallery, contact form)

### Admin Page Complexity Analysis
**DIFFICULTY LEVEL: MODERATE (6-8 hours of development)**

**Technical Challenges:**
1. **Authentication System**: Need simple password-based auth (not complex)
2. **Data Storage**: Current site is static - need to add data persistence
3. **File Upload**: Image upload functionality for Vercel deployment
4. **Content Management**: Dynamic content updates without rebuilds
5. **Security**: Admin access protection and input validation

**Architecture Decisions Needed:**
- **Database**: JSON file vs external database (Vercel KV, Supabase, or Airtable)
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob vs Cloudinary vs local storage
- **Authentication**: Simple password vs more secure options
- **Content Updates**: Real-time vs rebuild-triggered updates
